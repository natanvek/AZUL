# AZUL


## Descripci√≥n

It is a virtual version of the Azul board game. In December 2020, I created the game to be played locally between people. Then, in November 2021, I developed an artificial intelligence using the Monte Carlo Tree Search method, combined with other strategies to handle the inherent randomness of the game. This AI is configurable in terms of how much time it takes between moves. Moreover, it plays exceptionally well, on https://azee.mattle.online/lobby, it managed to rank among the top 30 best players on the platform.
